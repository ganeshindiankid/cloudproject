        <blockquote><em>"Architecture is a visual art, and the temples of India are its poetry."</em></blockquote>
        <p>India's ancient architecture reflects thousands of years of rich history, religion and artistry. These structures were built not just as homes or places of worship, but as expressions of divinity and cosmic alignment.</p>

  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Kailasa Temple</strong> at Ellora was carved from a single rock, top to bottom, using only chisels—an architectural marvel unmatched even today.</li>

    <li>Many Indian temples were designed according to <strong>Vastu Shastra</strong> and <strong>astronomical alignments</strong>, allowing light to fall on deities during solstices or festivals.</li>

    <li><strong>Dravidian temples</strong> typically feature towering gopurams (gateways), long mandapas (halls), and a sanctum called garbhagriha.</li>

    <li><strong>Nagara temples</strong> of North India are known for their curvilinear shikharas (towers) and intricate wall carvings.</li>

    <li>Some temples were constructed with <strong>interlocking stone techniques</strong>—no mortar was used—and they’ve stood the test of time for centuries.</li>
    
    <li>Temples often served as <strong>cultural hubs</strong>: centers for dance (Bharatanatyam, Odissi), music, astronomy, education, and even economics.</li>

  <h2>Historical Eras</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2500–1700 BCE)</strong> – One of the earliest urban cultures in the world, known for grid-pattern cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa with advanced drainage and standardized baked brick buildings.</li>

    <li><strong>Vedic Age (c. 1500–500 BCE)</strong> – Emergence of early wooden structures and fire altars; early foundations of sacred geometry and temple orientation were conceived during this period.</li>

    <li><strong>Maurya & Gupta Periods (c. 321 BCE–550 CE)</strong> – Introduction of grand stupas (e.g., Sanchi), stone columns like the Ashokan Pillars, and refinement of Buddhist architecture. Gupta temples set prototypes for later Hindu temple architecture.</li>

    <li><strong>Chalukya & Rashtrakuta Era (6th–10th century CE)</strong> – Famous for rock-cut and structural temples, especially the monolithic Kailasa Temple in Ellora and Pattadakal group of monuments.</li>

    <li><strong>Pallava & Chola Dynasties (7th–13th century CE)</strong> – Dravidian style flourished with temples like Brihadeshwara (Thanjavur) and shore temples at Mahabalipuram. Extensive use of granite and detailed carvings.</li>

    <li><strong>Mughal Period (16th–18th century CE)</strong> – A blend of Persian, Central Asian, and Indian traditions; use of white marble, domes, arches, and gardens. Notable examples include Qutub Minar and Taj Mahal.</li>
  </ul>
